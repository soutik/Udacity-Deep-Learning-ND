# Deep Learning - NanoDegree (Udacity)

This repository contains all the codes for assignments and projects that are a part of the Deep Learning NanoDegree program at Udacity.

__The following is a developing list of code that can be found in this repository:__

1. Build Neural Net from Scratch -- In this project I built a neural network from scratch using Numpy only. I implemented the backpropagation and forward propagation methods from scratch and then used the network to predict bike sharing.

2. Sentiment Network -- Here I take our neural network built in project 1 and used it to classify sentiments in texts. Here I implemented the word to vector and bag of words functions from scratch.

3. Sentiment Analysis using TFlearn - Here I used TFlearn to implement a sentiment analysis algorithm using neural networks.

4. MNIST Using TFlearn - In this assigment, I used TFlearn to successfully classify the MNIST handwritten digits using a deep neural network

5. Sentiment Analysis IMDB Recurrent Neural Net - Here I used recurrent neural networks to train a model to classify IMDB reviews as positive or negative

6. Intro to TensorFlow - In this, I have used TensorFlow to normalize, train and predict on the non-MNIST data.
